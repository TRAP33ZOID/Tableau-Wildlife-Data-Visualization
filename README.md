## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
1. Connected to the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset.
2. Detected and verified data types for analysis.
3. Explored the dataset through multiple visualizations.
4. Identified key categorical features and analyzed their distribution.
5. Extracted key insights and patterns from the data.
6. Formulated questions based on the exploration.

## Results
Option 2 was chosen, utilizing the FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015 dataset. Through various visualizations, it was identified that most strikes occur during the day, with birds being the most common wildlife involved.

Visualizations:
Strikes by State: From the "Strikes by State" visualization, we can identify the states with the highest number of strikes.It is seen that coastal states with higher number of populations therefore bigger and plenty of airports suffer the most number of strikes. example: california, New york, Florida. they are also states that lay within well know migration rutes for birds
Strikes by season: created a new measure called season to give us more insight. it is seen that strikes are more prevelant in the summer  because it is breeding season
Map: This provides a geographical view of the strikes, with color intensity indicating the frequency of strikes in each state.
Strikes by Wildlife Group: Highlights which species or groups of animals are most commonly involved in strikes. this data gives us an isight into the fact that birds are the most common culprits. we can also determine which species cause more damage.
Financial Cost of Strikes: Provides an understanding of the economic implications of wildlife strikes.
Strikes by Year:Shows the trend of wildlife strikes over the years, indicating if the situation is improving or worsening. This helps us predict future patterns.

Questions:
Which are the top three states with the highest number of wildlife strikes, and are these states major aviation hubs or located near large natural habitats?
Are there specific regions or clusters of states that show a significantly higher frequency of strikes
which  wildlife groups are frequently involved in strikes?
What is the average financial cost of wildlife strikes?
How do strikes vary by time of day, season, year?

## Challenges 
Ambiguity and vague instructions
time management 
Data types were not aligned with what they should be

## Future Goals
Intergrate flight path data to understand if certain paths are more prone to strikes
